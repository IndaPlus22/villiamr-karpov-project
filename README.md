# TODOS into Issues

This Github action will turn all your "TODO" comments into a issue in your Github repository. 

## How to use
It is simple! Just add this action to your Github repository. The action will each time you commit a new change look for TODOS and turn them into a issue.

## Notes
The action will for now only look for todos on the main branch. Other branches will be supported soon.
