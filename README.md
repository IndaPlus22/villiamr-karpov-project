## The project

Our idea is to make a tool for github that searches through all comments of a GIT repo in search of "TODO" comments. All these TODO comments will then be turned into issues on the GITHUB repo. The plan is for this tool to either run on your local machine or try and make it work through a GITHUB workflow. The code will primarily be done in Rust. The purpose is to learn about the use of APIS and also learn more about the Rust programming language. We will also work on optimzing so that the tool works as fast as possible.
